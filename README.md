# BLAZE

The Blaze accelerator for Apache Spark leverages native vectorized execution to accelerate query processing. It combines
the power of the [Apache Arrow-DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) library and the scale of the Spark distributed
computing framework.

Blaze takes a fully optimized physical plan from Spark, mapping it into DataFusion's execution plan, and performs native
plan computation in Spark executors.

Blaze is composed of the following high-level components:

- **Blaze Spark Extension**: hooks the whole accelerator into Spark execution lifetime.
- **Native Operators**: defines how each SparkPlan maps to its native execution counterparts.
- **JNI Gateways**: passing data and control through JNI boundaries.
- **Plan SerDe**: serialization and deserialization of DataFusion plan with protobuf.
- **Columnarized Shuffle**: shuffle data file organized in Arrow-IPC format.

Based on the inherent well-defined extensibility of DataFusion, Blaze can be easily extended to support:

- Various object stores.
- Operators.
- Simple and Aggregate functions.
- File formats.

We encourage you to [extend DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) capability directly and add the
supports in Blaze with simple modifications in plan-serde and extension translation.

## Build from source

To build Blaze, please follow the steps below:

1. Install Rust

The underlying native execution lib, DataFusion, is written in Rust Lang. So you're required to install Rust first for
compilation. We recommend you to use `rustup`.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Check out the source code.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:blaze-init/blaze.git
cd blaze
```

3. Build the project.

_You could either build Blaze in debug mode for testing purposes or in release mode to unlock the full potential of
Blaze._

```shell
./gradlew -Pmode=[debug|release] build
```

After the build is finished, a fat Jar package that contains all the dependencies will be generated in the `target`
directory.

## Run Spark Job with Blaze Accelerator

This section describes how to submit and configure a Spark Job with Blaze support.

You could enable Blaze accelerator through:

```shell
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-[sql|submit] \
  --jars "/path/to/blaze-engine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" \
  --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.spark.sql.blaze.BlazeSparkSessionExtension \
  --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.sql.blaze.execution.ArrowShuffleManager301 \
  --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath="./blaze-engine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" \
  .... # your original arguments goes here
```

At the same time, there are a series of configurations that you can use to control Blaze with more granularity.

| Parameter                                                         | Default value         | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| spark.executor.memoryOverhead                                     | executor.memory * 0.1 | The amount of non-heap memory to be allocated per executor. Blaze would use this part of memory. |
| spark.blaze.memoryFraction                                        | 0.75                  | A fraction of the off-heap that Blaze could use during execution.                                |
| spark.blaze.batchSize                                             | 16384                 | Batch size for vectorized execution.                                                             |
| spark.blaze.enable.shuffle                                        | true                  | If enabled, use native, Arrow-IPC based Shuffle.                                                 |
| spark.blaze.enalbe.[scan,project,filter,sort,union,sortmergejoin] | true                  | If enabled, offload the corresponding operator to native engine.                                 |


## Performance

We periodically benchmark Blaze locally with a 1 TB TPC-DS Dataset to show our latest results and prevent unnoticed
performance regressions. Check [Benchmark Results](./benchmark-results/tpc-ds.md) with the latest date for the performance
comparison with vanilla Spark.

We also encourage you to benchmark Blaze locally and share the results with us. ðŸ¤—

## Roadmap
### 1. Operators

Currently, there are still several operators that we cannot execute natively:
- Aggregate. Relies on https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/1570.
- Join with an optional filter condition. Relies on https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/2509.
- Broadcast HashJoin.
- Window.

### 2. Compressed Shuffle

We use segmented Arrow-IPC files to express shuffle data. If we could apply IPC compression,
we would benefit more from Shuffle since columnar data would have a better compression ratio. Tracked in [#4](https://github.com/blaze-init/blaze/issues/4).

### 3. UDF support
We would like to have a high-performance JVM-UDF invocation framework that could utilize a great variety
of the existing UDFs written in Spark/Hive language. They are not supported natively in Blaze at the moment.

## Community

We're using [Discussions](https://github.com/blaze-init/blaze/discussions) to connect with other members
of our community. We hope that you:
- Ask questions you're wondering about.
- Share ideas.
- Engage with other community members.
- Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together ðŸ’ª .
