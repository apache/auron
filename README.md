The Blaze accelerator for Apache Spark leverages native vectorized execution to accelerate query processing. It combines
the power of the [Apache DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) library and the scale of the Spark distributed
computing framework.

Blaze takes a fully optimized physical plan from Spark, mapping it into DataFusion's execution plan, and performs native
plan computation in Spark executors.

Blaze is composed of the following high-level components:

- **Spark Extension**: hooks the whole accelerator into Spark execution lifetime.
- **Spark Shims**: specialized codes for different versions of spark.
- **Native Engine**: implements the native engine in rust, including:
  - ExecutionPlan protobuf specification
  - JNI gateway
  - Customized operators, expressions, functions

Based on the inherent well-defined extensibility of DataFusion, Blaze can be easily extended to support:

- Various object stores.
- Operators.
- Simple and Aggregate functions.
- File formats.

We encourage you to [extend DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) capability directly and add the
supports in Blaze with simple modifications in plan-serde and extension translation.

## Build from source

To build Blaze, please follow the steps below:

1. Install Rust

The native execution lib is written in Rust. So you're required to install Rust (nightly) first for
compilation. We recommend you to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

2. Install Protobuf

Ensure `protoc` is available in PATH environment. protobuf can be installed via linux system package
manager (or Homebrew on mac), or manually download and build from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases .

3. Install JDK+Maven

Blaze has been well tested on jdk8 and maven3.5, should work fine with higher versions.

4. Check out the source code.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kwai/blaze.git
cd blaze
```

5. Build the project.

Specify shims package of which spark version that you would like to run on.

Currently, we have supported these shims:

* spark-3.0 - for spark3.0.x
* spark-3.1 - for spark3.1.x
* spark-3.2 - for spark3.2.x
* spark-3.3 - for spark3.3.x
* spark-3.4 - for spark3.4.x
* spark-3.5 - for spark3.5.x.

You could either build Blaze in pre mode for debugging or in release mode to unlock the full potential of
Blaze.

```shell
SHIM=spark-3.3 # or spark-3.0/spark-3.1/spark-3.2/spark-3.3/spark-3.4/spark-3.5
MODE=release # or pre
mvn clean package -P"${SHIM}" -P"${MODE}"
```

Skip build native (native lib is already built, and you can check the native lib in `native-engine/_build/${MODE}`).

```shell
SHIM=spark-3.3 # or spark-3.0/spark-3.1/spark-3.2/spark-3.3/spark-3.4/spark-3.5
MODE=release # or pre
mvn clean package -P"${SHIM}" -P"${MODE}" -DskipBuildNative
```

After the build is finished, a fat Jar package that contains all the dependencies will be generated in the `target`
directory.

## Build with docker

You can use the following command to build a centos-7 compatible release:
```shell
SHIM=spark-3.3 MODE=release ./release-docker.sh
```

## Run Spark Job with Blaze Accelerator

This section describes how to submit and configure a Spark Job with Blaze support.

1. move blaze jar package to spark client classpath (normally `spark-xx.xx.xx/jars/`).

2. add the follow confs to spark configuration in `spark-xx.xx.xx/conf/spark-default.conf`:

```properties
spark.blaze.enable true
spark.sql.extensions org.apache.spark.sql.blaze.BlazeSparkSessionExtension
spark.shuffle.manager org.apache.spark.sql.execution.blaze.shuffle.BlazeShuffleManager
spark.memory.offHeap.enabled false

# suggested executor memory configuration
spark.executor.memory 4g
spark.executor.memoryOverhead 4096
```

3. submit a query with spark-sql, or other tools like spark-thriftserver:
```shell
spark-sql -f tpcds/q01.sql
```

## Integrate with Apache Celeborn
Blaze has supported Celeborn integration now, use the following configurations to enable shuffling with Celeborn:

```properties

# change celeborn endpoint and storage directory to the correct location
spark.shuffle.manager org.apache.spark.sql.execution.blaze.shuffle.celeborn.BlazeCelebornShuffleManager
spark.serializer org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
spark.celeborn.master.endpoints localhost:9097
spark.celeborn.client.spark.shuffle.writer hash
spark.celeborn.client.push.replicate.enabled false
spark.celeborn.storage.availableTypes HDFS
spark.celeborn.storage.hdfs.dir hdfs:///home/celeborn
spark.sql.adaptive.localShuffleReader.enabled false
```

## Performance

Check [TPC-H Benchmark Results](./benchmark-results/tpch.md).
The latest benchmark result shows that Blaze saved more than 50% time on TPC-H 1TB datasets comparing with Vanilla Spark 3.5.

Stay tuned and join us for more upcoming thrilling numbers.
